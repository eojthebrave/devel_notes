This module was written as an expirement to allow someone to leave notes about either a complete page or a specific DOM element on the page.

When the module is enabled you can visit any page on your site and you'll see a small black box labled "Notes" in the lower right corner of the page. Clicking on this box will reveal the notes interface.

You can then leave a not by filling out the form and clicking submit. Optionally use your mouse to select any element on the page while the notes interface is active, the element will be highlighted and you can click on that element to leave a note about that specific element.

When someone else visits the page they'll see the same black box in the lower right but it will show a badge indicating the number of notes on that page. Clicking to reveal the notes interface will display all notes for that page and and higlight any element that has a note associated with. However over the highlighted element to see the related note or hover over the note to see the releated element.

The module also provides a complete administrative interface for dealing with notes and also provides views integration for notes.

This was written as an expirement and was used for about 6 months with good success. However, I haven't used it in years and am just making it available now incase it is useful for anyone else. At the time we used it as part of a developement workflow that included building out the wireframes for a site using Drupapl and then allowing people to review and leave notes with this module.
